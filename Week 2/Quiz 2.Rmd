What is produced by the following code?

```{r}

library(nlme)
library(lattice)

head(BodyWeight)
xyplot(weight ~ Time | Diet, BodyWeight)  
  
  
```
Load the `airquality' dataset form the datasets package in R


I am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. What would be the appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2?


```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data(airquality)

head(airquality)
?lpoints

airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)


```
